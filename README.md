## What This App Does:

customer.js displays the available items for purchase, ask the customer which item they would like, how many of that item they would like, and after checking if available stock is adequate, will inform the customer their purchase was successful, calculate their total cost, and subtract the purchase quantity from the database.

manager.js provides the user four options: display all items, display items with low inventory (a quantity specified by the user), increase inventory of an item in the database, and add a new item entirely.

## What This App Could Do:
